game description by Jack:

Pebble rules:
This can be played 1-4 players, each player is given a configuration sheet at random, they may put their sheet down facing any way they like but from this point on the sheets are locked in place. 
The aim of the game is for you to have pebbles in the configuration of the shapes they have on their sheet. They must first complete the triangle configuration, then the squares, then the pentagon’s. 
Once you have completed a configuration you call out “pebble” and remove one of the pebbles from the configuration you have completed, placing it at your edge of the board over the shape of configuration you have completed, you do not need to keep pebbles in this configuration any more and move on to the next shape.
The board starts with a pebble in the middle and a four other pebbles which have been placed at random. 
Each player must make a move each turn, they can move any pebble (any pebble which has been moved by the player before you is “locked” and cannot be moved by you)
You can move a single pebble, or you can move a line of pebbles, they can only be moved horizontally or vertically.
If the centre space of the board is ever empty it is automatically refilled with another pebble, this new pebble is also “locked” and may not be moved by the next player.
If any of your configurations are completed on another players turn you call pebble and remove one of the pebbles, the game then continues in turn order as normal.
